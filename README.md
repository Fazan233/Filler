# Filler
Here I will write a bot for the game named Filler. It's an algorithmic project in the school of 42.

Create your player to fight other students on the famous (or not) Filler board. The rules are simple: two players fight on a board and, in turn, must place the piece given to them by the game master (a Ruby executable), thereby scoring points. The game ends when a piece cannot be placed. A small fun game project.
